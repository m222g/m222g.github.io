It was settled in 1636 but wasn't incorporated until November 5, 1832 (Encyclop√¶dia, 2024).  Being one of New England's first cities, it is home to many historic homes and buildings.  What is now the Visitors' Center at Roger Williams National Memorial, was a house built in 1736 (Wikimedia, 2024a).  This house is older than America!
